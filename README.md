# dexforge
A custom Pokémon Pokédex built with HTML, JavaScript, and JSON — designed as a flexible Pokémon data system for my streaming channel. Users can interact with the system through the stream chat.

This project is part of my personal gaming/dev experiments and is designed to be:
- Easy to extend
- Fully client-side
- Pokémon-themed without relying on external APIs

## Features
- Reads Pokémon data from a local JSON file
- Displays Pokémon entries in a Pokédex-style interface
- Designed with a classic Pokémon aesthetic
- Easy to customize or expand with new data

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- JSON data files
- Mix It Up (Stream Bot)

## Project Status
🚧 Work in progress — actively being expanded.
